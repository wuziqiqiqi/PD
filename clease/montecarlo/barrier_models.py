    BEP barrier implements the Bell-Evans-Polanyi model. It is a simple barrier
    model where the barrier is modelled by the dilute barrier, corrected by
    the change in total energy before and after the jump.

    E_a = Q_s + alpha*(E_2 - E_1)

    where E_1 is the total energy of starting configuration and E_2 is the
    total energy of the end configuration. Q_s is a constant that depends
    on the species. If an isolated solute is diffusing in a host material
    E_1 = E_2. Thus, Q_s represents the barrier of an isolated solute. References:

    :param dilute_barrier: Dictionary representing the dilute barrier for
        each species. Example {'Al': 0.05, 'Mg': 0.03}
    :param alpha: Scalar quantity between 0 and 1 that characterises the position
        of the transition state along the reaction coordinate. Default is 0.5.
        Note as alpha is the same for all jumps, it must be viewed as
        controlling the average barrier position.
