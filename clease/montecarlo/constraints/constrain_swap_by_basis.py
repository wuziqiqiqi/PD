class ConstrainSwapByBasis(MCConstraint):
    """
    Constraint that restricts swaps of atoms within a given basis.
    This constraint is intended to be used together with canonical
    Monte Carlo calculations where the trial moves consist of swapping
    two atoms.

    Parameters:

    atoms: Atoms object
        ASE Atoms object used in the MC simulation

    index_by_basis: list
        Indices ordered by basis (same as `index_by_basis` parameter in
        `ClusterExpansionSettings`).
        If an Atoms object has 10 sites where the first 4 belongs to the
        first basis, the next 3 belongs to the next basis and the last 3
        belongs to the last basis, the `index_by_basis` would be
        [[0, 1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

    Note: swaps are only allowed within each basis, not across two basis.
