Publications Using CLEASE
==========================

If you found CLEASE to be a useful tool and have used it in a publication, we
invite you to add your work to the list below. This makes it easy for other
CLEASE users to see your work as well as showing examples of research topics
where cluster expansion techniques are useful. The list is sorted by
publication date, where the latest publications appear on top. In order to
add a contribution to the list, you can open a merge request to the `CLEASE
repository <https://gitlab.com/computationalmaterials/clease>`_.
