        Remove the feature corresponding to the smallest coefficient
        iteratively. On each step, modified Afaike information
        crieterion is calculated (AICC). The features in the model
        with the smallest AICC is selected. This will favour models
        with fewer coefficients.

        Parameters:

        fitter:
            LinearRegression fitting scheme

        X:
            Design matrix of size (N x M) where N is the number of data points
            and M is the number of features

        y:
            Numpy array with the target values. The length must be N.

        Return:
            List with the index of the coefficient selected in the model with
            the lowest CV score and the coefficient array.

            Example:

            If the following is returned
            [0, 4, 8, 9], [0.1, 0.5, 0.8, -1.0]
            it means that feature no. 0, 4, 8 and 9 was selected. The
            coefficients corresponding to these features are returned in the
            second array. The coefficients of all other features in the model
            is zero.
