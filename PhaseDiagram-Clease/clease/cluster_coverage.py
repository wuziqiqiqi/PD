class ClusterCoverageChecker:
    """
    Class for checking how large fraction of the possible configurational variation of
    all the clusters is captured by a set of template atoms. The origin of decrease in
    coverage is that for small cells, some clusters wraps around and thus interact with
    a periodic image. In a very large cell (much larger than the cluster diameters)
    there are no such "wrap-rounds".

    Example:

    In a huge cell a particular pair cluster consists of the figures
    [[0, 765], [0, 87], [0, 2], [0, 6]]

    When a small cell is used, some of the interactions will wrap around. If
    87, 765 is a periodic image of atom no. 4 and 6 is a periodic image of 2
    we have

    [[0, 4], [0, 4], [0, 2], [0, 2]]

    thus, no matter which species occupies the different sites in the small cell,
    one cannot cover all possible variation in this cluster. We define the
    coverage as <num unique figs>/<tot num figs>. Above we have two unique figs
    ([0, 4] and [0, 2]) and the total number of figures is 4. Thus, the covarage is 2/4 = 0.5.

    Some numeric examples:

    Figures                                    Coverage
    [[0, 1], [0, 5], [0, 3], [0, 7]]           1.0
    [[0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]]           0.25
    [[0, 1], [0, 1], [0, 4], [0, 8]]           0.75
    [[0, 1], [0, 1], [0, 1], [0, 3]]           0.5
    [[0, 1], [0, 1], [0, 3], [0, 3]]           0.5
