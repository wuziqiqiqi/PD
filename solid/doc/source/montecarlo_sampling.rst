Monte Carlo Sampling
--------------------
CLEASE currently support two ensembles for Monte Carlo sampling: canonical and
semi-grand canonical ensembles. A canonical ensemble has a fixed number of
atoms, concentration and temperature while a semi-grand canonical ensemble has
a fixed number of atoms, temperature and chemical potential.
To use a fitted CE model to run MC sampling we first initialise
*small* cell holding the nessecary information about the lattice
and the clusters

.. code-block:: python

  from clease.settings import CEBulk, Concentration
  conc = Concentration(basis_elements=[['Au', 'Cu']])
  settings = CEBulk(crystalstructure='fcc',
                    a=3.8,
                    supercell_factor=27,
                    concentration=conc,
                    db_name="aucu.db",
                    max_cluster_dia=[6.0, 5.0])

Next, we need to specify a set if ECIs. These can for instance be loaded
from a file, but here we hard code them for simplicity

.. code-block:: python

  eci = {'c0': -1.0, 'c1_0': 0.1, 'c2_d0000_0_00': -0.2}

For efficient initialisation of large cells, CLEASE comes with a
convenient helper function called *attach_calculator*. We create our
MC cell by repeating the *atoms* object of the settings.

.. code-block:: python

  from clease.calculator import attach_calculator
  atoms = settings.atoms.copy()*(5, 5, 5)
  atoms = attach_calculator(settings, atoms=atoms, eci=eci)

Let's insert a few *Cu* atoms

.. code-block:: python

  atoms[0].symbol = 'Cu'
  atoms[1].symbol = 'Cu'
  atoms[2].symbol = 'Cu'

We are now ready to run a MC calculation

.. code-block:: python

  from clease.montecarlo import Montecarlo
  T = 500
  mc = Montecarlo(atoms, T)
  mc.run(steps=1000)

After a MC run, you can retrieve internal energy, heat capacity etc. by calling

.. code-block:: python

  thermo = mc.get_thermodynamic_quantities()

Monitoring a MC run
-------------------
In many cases it is useful to be able to monitor the evolution of parameters
during a run, and not simply getting the quantities after the run is finished.
A good example can be to monitor the evolution of the energy in order to
determine whether the system has reached equilibrium. CLEASE comes with a
special set of classes called *MCObservers* for this task. As an example, we
can store a value for the energy every 100 iteration by

.. code-block:: python

  from clease.montecarlo.observers import EnergyEvolution
  obs = EnergyEvolution(mc)
  mc.attach(obs, interval=100)
  mc.run(steps=1000)
  energies = obs.energies

Another useful observer is the *Snapshot* observer. This observers
takes snaptshots of the configuration at regular intervals and stores
them in a trajectory file.

.. code-block:: python

  from clease.montecarlo.observers import Snapshot
  snap = Snapshot(atoms, fname='snapshot')
  mc.attach(snap, interval=200)
  mc.run(steps=1000)

There are many more observers distributes with CLEASE, for a complete list
check the API documentation.

Constraining the MC sampling
----------------------------
In some cases you might want to prevent certain moves to occur.
That can for instance be that certain elements should remain fixed.
CLEASE offers the possibility to impose arbitrary constraint via
its *MCConstraint* functionality. *MCConstraints* can be added in a
very similar fashion as the observers. To fix one element

.. code-block:: python

  from clease.montecarlo.constraints import FixedElement
  cnst = FixedElement('Cu')
  mc.generator.add_constraint(cnst)

Note, that the usage of a constraint in this system is a bit weird as it
has only two elements. Hence, fixing one prevents any move from happening.
But the point here is just to illustrate how a constraint can be attached.

.. note::
  If your system has multiple basis, you most likely want to add a
  :class:`~clease.montecarlo.constraints.constrain_swap_by_basis.ConstrainSwapByBasis`
  constraint object, in order to avoid swaps happening across different basis sites.
  The Montecarlo object will not automatically avoid cross-basis swaps.

Implementing Your Own Observer
------------------------------
.. _implementing your own observer:

You can implement your own observer and monitor whatever quantity
you might be interested in. To to so you can create your own class that
inherits from the base *MCObserver* class. To illustrate the usage,
let's create an observers that monitor how many *Cu* atoms there
are on average in each (100) layer!

Before we initialise this monitor we need to make sure that
the tag of each atom represents the corresponding layer.

.. code-block:: python

  from clease.montecarlo.observers import MCObserver
  from ase.geometry import get_layers
  class LayerMonitor(MCObserver):
     def __init__(self, atoms):
         self.layers, _ = get_layers(atoms, [1, 0, 0])
         self.layer_average = [0 for _ in set(self.layers)]
         self.num_calls = 1
         # Initialise the structure
         for atom in atoms:
             if atom.symbol == 'Cu':
                 self.layer_average[self.layers[atom.index]] += 1

     def observe_step(self, step):
         self.num_calls += 1
         system_changes = step.last_change
         for change in system_changes:
             layer = self.layers[change[0]]
             if change[2] == 'Cu':
                 self.layer_average[layer] += 1
             if change[1] == 'Cu':
                 self.layer_average[layer] -= 1

     def get_averages(self):
         return {'layer{}'.format(i): x/self.num_calls for i, x in enumerate(self.layer_average)}

When this observer is attached, the `observe_step` method will be executed
on every Monte Carlo step. The call signature takes in a
:class:`~clease.datastructures.mc_step.MCStep` instance.
The `system_changes` variable here is a list of
the following form `[(10, Au, Cu), (34, Cu, Au)]` which means that the
symbol on site 10 changes from Au to Cu and the symbol on site 34 changes
from Cu to Au. Hence, in the update algorithm above we check if
the last element of a single change is equal to Cu, if so we know that
there is one additional Cu atom in the new layer. And if the middle
element of a change is equal to Cu, there is one less atom in the
corresponding layer. Note that if a MC move is rejected the `system_changes`
will typically be `[(10, Au, Au), (34, Cu, Cu)]`. The `get_averages` function
returns a dictionary. This method is optinal to implement, but if it is
implemented the result will automatically be added to the result of
`get_thermodynamic_quantities`

To use this observer in our calculation

.. code-block:: python

  monitor = LayerMonitor(atoms)
  mc = Montecarlo(atoms, T)
  mc.attach(monitor, interval=1)
  mc.run(steps=1000)

There are a few other methods that can be useful to implement. First,
the `reset` method. This method can be invoked if the `reset` method
of the mc calculation is called.


Implementing Your Own Constraints
==================================
.. _implementing your own constraints:

If you want to have custom constraints on MC moves, CLEASE
lets you implement your own. The idea is to create a class
that inherits from the base *MCConstraint* class and has a
function *__call__** that returns `True` if a move is valid
and `False` if a move is not valid. To illustrate this, let's
say that we want the atoms on sites less that 25 to remain
fixed. The reason for doing so, can be that you have a set of
indices that you know constitutes a surface and you want to keep
them fixed.

.. code-block:: python

  from clease.montecarlo.constraints import MCConstraint
  class FixedIndices(MCConstraint):
     def __call__(self, system_changes):
         for change in system_changes:
             if change.index <= 25:
                 return False
         return True

To use this constrain in our calculation

.. code-block:: python

  cnst = FixedIndices()
  mc.generator.add_constraint(cnst)
  mc.run(steps=1000)

Sampling the SGC Ensemble
==========================
CLEASE also gives the possibility to perform MC sampling
in the semi grand canonical ensemble. Everything that has
to do with observers and constraints mentioned above can also
be used together with this class. To run a calcualtion in
the SGC ensemble

.. code-block:: python

  from clease.montecarlo import SGCMonteCarlo
  sgc_mc = SGCMonteCarlo(atoms, T, symbols=['Au', 'Cu'])
  sgc_mc.run(steps=1000, chem_pot={'c1_0': -0.15})

The `chem_pot` parameter sets the chemical potentials. It is possible
to set one chemical potential for each singlet correlation function
(i.e. ECIs that starts with *c1*).
